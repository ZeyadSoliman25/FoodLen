# FoodLen: AI-Powered Food Detection and Calorie Estimation
FoodLen is a machine learning-powered application that automates meal recognition and nutritional tracking. By leveraging advanced image recognition models, the system detects various food items from images, estimates their caloric content, and retrieves detailed nutritional information from the USDA Food and Nutrient Database.

## Key Features:
- Food Detection: Utilizes machine learning models from Hugging Face (kaludi/food-category-classification-v2.0, nateraw/food) and a custom-built model for precise recognition of fruits and vegetables.
- Nutritional Information: Seamless integration with the USDA database to provide detailed nutritional breakdown, including proteins, fats, carbohydrates, vitamins, and minerals.
- Streamlit Interface: Built with Streamlit for a user-friendly and intuitive interface, making meal logging as simple as snapping a photo.
